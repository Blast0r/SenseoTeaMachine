# SenseoTeaMachine

This is at the Moment only a very first attempt to build a Hot Water machine using parts from an old Senseo Coffe-machine.
I will try to update this repository in the next time also i will try to improve the controlling of the heater.


## ToDO
* add PID like controller for temperature control
* temperature control when pumping and heating
* maybe: Add a display
* "user interface buttons" make the amount of hot water adjustable with buttons (press and hold until it is enough)

##Temperature Callibration
I have callibrated the Thermistor with a scetch provided by Adafruit. See this Repo for more information: https://github.com/tdicola/CloudThermometer

## Notice
